ToP Recipe Website Project

This is a project related to completing The Odin Project.

It will utilize HTML to create a simple website of recipes.

I'll be demonstrating an understanding of:

	-HTML Syntax

	-Basic HTML Tags

	-Git


Later I will augment this project with CSS, but that will come later :)

Edit: so dope that my text editor displayed this very broken on GitHub initially. *very Tony Soprano Voice* Ey I'm Still Learning Here!
