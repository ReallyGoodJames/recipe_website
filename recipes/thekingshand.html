    <h2>The Kings Hand Recipe</h2>

    <p>Originating in Twitter User <a href="https://twitter.com/thatfrood/status/1335689951640494080?lang=en" target="_blank">@Neo Cannolialist's</a> dreams. The Kings Hand is a dreamworld delicacy.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 Pound of M&Ms</li>
        <li>1 Tube of your favorite Cookie Dough</li>
        <li>Ovensafe Foodgrade Silicone Plastique Mold</li>
        <li>Greek Salad</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>First, you will need to make a mold of a hand. For this I used food grade silicon putty safe up to 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>Make M&M cookie dough. I just took some recipe off online</li>
        <li>Fill your mold with the dough</li>
        <li>Put the m&ms for the nails and knuckles in first</li>
        <li>Set the oven to a lower temp than the recipe requires (mine was 325 vs 375) and bake for like 2-3 times as long</li>
        <li>Take it out and scoop out dough for the base and to make it hollow</li>
        <li>Flatten the scooped out stuff into a thin sheet and put in the oven to bake, along with the hand again. I dunno, I did like 10 minutes. Raise the temp back up to bc now you want it hot and baked</li>
        <li>Take it out and freeze it! Gotta be cool and solid to demold. Meanwhile chop up the Greek salad.</li>
        <li>When it is solid remove from the mold, cut around the hand to remove the overhanging edges</li>
        <li>Fill with salad, cover with base, and you have the Kingâ€™s Hand</li>
    </ol>
